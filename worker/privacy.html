    <p class="subtitle">Localyse — Figma Plugin &middot; Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <h2>What Localyse Does</h2>
    <p>Localyse is a Figma plugin that translates text layers in your design frames into
    multiple locales. It helps designers create localised versions of their designs
    directly on the Figma canvas.</p>

    <h2>Data We Process</h2>
    <p>When you click <strong>Generate Translations</strong>, the following data is sent to our
    translation proxy:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Text content</strong> from the text layers in your selected frame</li>
      <li><strong>Layer names</strong> (used as context hints for more accurate translations)</li>
      <li><strong>Target locale code</strong> (e.g. fr, ja, ar)</li>
      <li><strong>Currency codes</strong> (if selected, e.g. USD, EUR — used for currency localisation)</li>
      <li><strong>Your Figma user ID</strong> (used solely for rate limiting — 50 requests/day)</li>
      <li><strong>Your IP address</strong> (used as a secondary rate-limiting measure; stored temporarily for up to 24 hours)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="highlight">
      <strong>We do not collect or log any of your design content.</strong> Text is forwarded to
      the translation services in real time and the response is returned to your plugin.
      Translated results may be cached on our servers for up to 1 hour to speed up repeated
      requests — cached data auto-deletes after that. Your Figma user ID and IP address are
      stored temporarily (up to 24 hours) in counters for rate limiting purposes only.
    </div>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Translations are powered by <strong>Microsoft Azure Translator</strong>. Your text content is
    sent to Azure's Translator API to generate translations. Microsoft's use of this data is governed by
    their <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/translator/transparency-note" target="_blank">Translator
    transparency note</a> and <a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement" target="_blank">Privacy Statement</a>.
    Azure Translator does not store your submitted text after translation is complete.</p>

    <p>Translations may also be refined through <strong>OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini</strong> model for
    contextual accuracy — improving currency formatting, date localisation, and natural phrasing.
    When this refinement is enabled, your text content and target locale are sent to the
    <a href="https://api.openai.com" target="_blank">OpenAI API</a>. OpenAI's use of this data
    is governed by their <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Privacy
    Policy</a>. Per OpenAI's API data usage policy, data sent via the API is not used to train their models.</p>

    <h2>Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Your Figma account email or name</li>
      <li>Your design files or images</li>
      <li>Analytics, cookies, or tracking data</li>
      <li>Any personally identifiable information beyond the anonymous Figma user ID</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Rate Limiting</h2>
    <p>To ensure fair usage, each user is limited to <strong>50 translation requests per day</strong>.
    Your anonymous Figma user ID is stored in a temporary counter that automatically expires after
    24 hours. As a secondary abuse-prevention measure, your IP address is also used for rate limiting
    with a separate daily cap. No other data is associated with these counters.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>Localyse does not have a traditional database. The translation proxy is a Cloudflare Worker
    that uses temporary key-value storage for two purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Rate-limit counters</strong> (user ID → request count, IP → request count) — auto-delete after 24 hours</li>
      <li><strong>Translation cache</strong> (hashed request → translated result) — auto-deletes after 1 hour</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No other data is stored. All temporary entries are automatically purged after their expiry.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since we do not store personal data beyond a temporary anonymous counter, there is
    nothing to request deletion of. The counter expires automatically. If you have any
    questions or concerns, please contact us.</p>
